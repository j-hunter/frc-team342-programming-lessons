# Computing basics

This guide will explain basic information for using a computer and being a part
of the programming team. Most of this information should either be common
knowledge that students have before starting on the programming team, or should
be easy for new students to quickly understand.

# 4. What is a programming language?

A programming language is how people instruct a computer what to do. Most
languages are somewhere on a spectrum from 'lower level': closer to how a
computer thinks (C++), and 'higher level': closer to how a person thinks
(python) (TODO maybe include graphical languages such as scratch and that one
language some teams use).

# 4.2 Difference between markup languages and programming languages

A popular starting point for new programmers is HTML: Hyper text markup
language. However, html is not a programming language. As it's name states, it
is a markup language. A 'markup language' is used to tell how computer how to
display information. Important markup languages include HTML, latex and
markdown.

So if HTML is not a programming langage, then what is? There are many common
languages, the most popular language to team 342 is Java.
