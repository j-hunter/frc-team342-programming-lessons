# Getting Started 

Start here!  This section will cover the setup of the required tools to program
for the team. Head into each folder in order (starting with 01-git) to get
started programming with FIRST Team 342.

# Git

Our team uses the version control system <a href=www.git-scm.com>Git</a> to
manage code and other related projects. Which git tools you use is up to you,
but these lessons will cover the installation and use of Git for Windows.

Also basic text editing concepts may be included here to practice working with
version control of text files.

# Basic computer concepts

TODO Basic computer science and computer system knowledge that students are
expected to know to be successful on the programming team. Does not have to
be strict requirement, but beginners would be suggested to do more studying on
their own. Without these concepts, the students may not be able to make
significant contributions to the programming team because they won't be able to
work well with other programming students and will frequently need refreshers
on topics. This should also help judge a students proficiency.

Some example concepts:

1. What is a programming language

2. What are the critical components of a computer

3. Comparison of tasks that computers and robots do well vs tasks humans do
   well

4. How computer networks work

5. Basic troubleshooting

6. Basic windows configuration and useful tools

# Programming

## Java

TODO Practice java concepts that will be useful for robot java development

## Python

TODO python

# Pi/roborio/git linux shell basics

include a tutorial of basic commands.

Eg:

* exit

* cat

* vi and vim and nano and emacs

* less

* tail

* more

* grep

* cd

* TODO most coreutils?

TODO Very basic introduction to working with the linux command line, which is
occasionally useful for working with some lower level configuration details.

## Opencv

Opencv is used on a pi with the python opencv bindings.

TODO Used for object detection and other image processing. slightly advanced
concept.

# Robotics

Include a detailed explanation of all concepts used for development of robot in
build season. 

TODO Be careful to keep pure-java related concepts under the java section.
